## About the project
This is a team project conducted during the IN2000: Software Engineering course at the University of Oslo. Our team consisted of six members. The source code was originally hosted on UiO's GitHub Enterprise, but has been copied to allow external sccess and visibility.

## Documentation
The application is documented through comments in the code. The Markdown file ARCHITECTURE.md provides an overview of the architecture through an architecture drawing, a textual description, and an overview of the API levels, tools and the APIs we have used.


## Information about libraries

* Proto DataStore
* KTOR
* LocalDateTime
* MapBox
* Jetpack Compose
* Material3

## Explanation of warnings
* We have one warning in the IDE in SurfAreaScreen and DailyScreen. The Material3.TopAppBar library has been deprecated. We didn't see a quick way to manage it, so we chose to keep using it.
